# MercadoPago-With-NodeJS
A simple "step-by-step" guide showing how to use the MercadoPago's API to make payments.

<hr>

Before starting, I want to make it clear that I'm actually a newbie on using this API, so there's probably a lot of better ways to do it. So here, I'll be focusing on showing the simplest way (in my opinion) to configure it with Node.

<h3>1. Requirements:</h3>
<p>
  Not a lot of things, so I'll be showing the packages that you'll need, and the npm comand to install'em.
  Packages:
  <ol>
    <li>Mercadopago: npm i mercadopago</li>
    <li>express</li>
    <li>ejs</li>
    <li>nodemon</li>
    <li>sucrase</li>
  </ol>
